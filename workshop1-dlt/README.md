# Data Engineering Essentials Workshop

## Introduction
This workshop is designed to equip participants with foundational and advanced techniques in data ingestion, emphasizing practical applications in data engineering.

## Workshop Modules
### Module 1: Efficient Data Extraction
This module covers the critical aspect of data extraction from various sources, emphasizing strategies to handle large volumes of data without overloading system resources.

#### Key Considerations in Data Extraction
- **API Data Retrieval:** Understanding different types of APIs (RESTful, database, etc.) and their data formats (JSON, Parquet).
- **Memory and Network Limits:** Strategies to manage memory usage effectively and handle network instability.
- **API Rate Limits:** Navigating API constraints to ensure smooth data extraction.

#### Extracting Data Without Hitting Hardware Limits
- Discusses the importance of managing memory and storage to prevent system crashes.
- Introduces the concept of streaming data to efficiently handle large datasets.

#### Streaming Data with Python Generators
- Provides insights into using Python generators for memory-efficient data streaming.
- Examples include streaming data from APIs to local files, event queues, and directly to storage solutions.

This module sets the foundation for building robust data extraction pipelines, focusing on efficiency and reliability. It prepares participants for advanced topics in data normalization and loading covered in subsequent modules.

### Module 2: Data Normalization

Data normalization is a critical step in data preparation, ensuring data quality and usability for analysis and reporting. This module explores the fundamental aspects of data normalization, including metadata management and data restructuring.

#### Key Concepts in Data Normalization
- **Data Cleaning:** Often misconstrued as merely filtering data, cleaning encompasses a broad range of actions to prepare data for analysis, without altering its meaning.
- **Metadata Work:** A significant portion of data cleaning, focusing on:
  - **Type Addition:** Converting data types for consistency (e.g., strings to numbers or timestamps).
  - **Column Renaming:** Standardizing column names to avoid conflicts in downstream processes.
  - **Dictionary Flattening:** Transforming nested dictionaries into top-level dictionary rows.
  - **Unnesting Lists/Arrays:** Converting lists or arrays into separate tables for a flattened data structure.

#### Practical Example
A practical example is provided, utilizing a complex dataset to illustrate the normalization process. This includes adding types, renaming columns, flattening nested structures, and unnesting arrays into child tables.

#### Challenges in Using JSON Data Directly
- **Schema Ambiguity:** JSON's flexibility can lead to inconsistencies, making it challenging to understand and use the data effectively.
- **Type Enforcement:** Without enforced data types, data inconsistency can occur, leading to potential errors in data processing and analysis.
- **Performance Issues:** Directly using JSON for analysis can be inefficient, as it may require reading entire documents into memory, leading to increased costs and slower processing times.

#### Solutions and Best Practices
- **Data Preparation:** Techniques for converting JSON into more structured and efficient formats for analysis.
- **Performance Optimization:** Strategies for minimizing memory usage and improving data processing speed.

This module equips participants with the knowledge to perform essential data normalization tasks, ensuring high-quality data for analysis. The practical example underscores the importance of thorough data preparation and introduces best practices for handling complex data structures.


### Module 3: Incremental Data Loading

Incremental loading is a key technique in data engineering, focusing on efficiently updating datasets with new data without reloading the entire dataset. This module explores the concepts and methodologies for implementing incremental data loading in data pipelines.

#### Understanding Incremental Loading
- **Definition:** Loading only new or changed data since the last load, optimizing resource usage and reducing processing time.
- **Benefits:** Faster pipeline execution, reduced costs, and minimized data transfer volumes.

#### Key Concepts
- **Incremental Extraction:** Extracting only the subset of data that has changed or is new since the last extraction.
- **State Management:** Keeping track of what data has been loaded to determine which data needs to be loaded next.
- **dlt Support:** Utilizing `dlt` (Data Loading Tool) to automate incremental loading processes, including state management.

#### Incremental Loading Strategies
1. **Append-Only Loads:**
   - Suitable for immutable or stateless data, such as new records that do not affect existing data.
   - Examples include logging events or daily sales data where new data is continuously added.
2. **Merge (Upsert) Loads:**
   - Applied to data that changes over time, requiring updates to existing records.
   - Useful for datasets where records can be updated, deleted, or inserted, maintaining data integrity and currency.

#### Implementing Incremental Loading
- **dlt Features:** Exploring how `dlt` facilitates incremental loading through append and merge operations.
- **Practical Example:** Demonstrating incremental loading using a dataset, highlighting the steps to configure and execute append and merge strategies with `dlt`.

#### Best Practices
- **Efficiency:** Tips for optimizing incremental loads, such as filtering changes at the source and minimizing data transformation.
- **Reliability:** Ensuring data consistency through comprehensive state management and error handling.
